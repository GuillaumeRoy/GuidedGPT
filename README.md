# Welcome to the GuidedGPT JSON Prompt for ChatGPT 

This README provides the necessary instructions to fully utilize the GuidedGPT JSON prompt with ChatGPT.

## Overview

Tired of run-of-the-mill, fill-in-the-blanks ChatGPT prompt templates? Welcome to GuidedGPT. This repository contains a complex JSON prompt designed for ChatGPT that turns the tables. Instead of prompting the AI, the AI prompts you. 

üëâ **[An example here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/guillaumer_guidedgpt-sample-activity-7079481704112906240-biS9)** üëà

The GuidedGPT JSON prompt guides the conversation, prompting the AI to ask a series of detailed questions, thereby enhancing the quality of the user-AI interaction. This approach is based on current prompt engineering best practices and is inspired by a talk titled "SCOPING & ESTIMATING ANYTHING IN 5 MINUTES‚Äù.

## Usage Instructions

Follow these steps to utilize the JSON prompt:

1. Copy the contents of the üëâ **[JSON file](/GuidedGPT.json)** üëà.
2. Initiate a new ChatGPT conversation.
3. Paste the copied contents at the start of the conversation.
4. Proceed with the conversation as prompted by the AI.

## Limitations

There are a few important limitations to note:

1. The JSON prompt is compatible only with ChatGPT version 4. Earlier versions are not supported.
2. Using this JSON file can consume your daily GPT-4 message allowance rapidly, so monitor your usage.
